## 👋 About this repository

This portfolio applies **data engineering and software development** to problems I've lived as a civil and railway engineer.

Every project here is inspired by real challenges I encountered at Deutsche Bahn and on large infrastructure programmes — cost overruns, schedule slippage, reporting overhead, and the difficulty of making sense of messy project data under deadline pressure.

The goal: **turn raw project data into decisions**.

### 🚆 Railway & Infrastructure Analytics *(incoming)*

| Project | Description | Tech | Status |
|---------|-------------|------|--------|
| Cost Deviation Tracker | Visualises planned vs actual costs across project phases. Flags deviation thresholds and produces PDF summary reports. | Pandas, Plotly, ReportLab | [✅ Live](https://cost-tracker.streamlit.app/) |
| Schedule Risk Dashboard | Monte Carlo simulation on activity durations to estimate P50/P80 completion dates. | NumPy, Plotly | 📋 Planned |
| Progress S-Curve Generator | Generates earned-value S-curves from raw progress data exports. | Pandas, Matplotlib | 📋 Planned |

---

### ⚙️ Construction Automation *(incoming)*

| Project | Description | Tech | Status |
|---------|-------------|------|--------|
| Automated Weekly Report Generator | Pulls data from Excel tracker → fills a Word template → emails it. Saves ~2 hours/week of manual work. | openpyxl, python-docx, smtplib | 🚧 In progress |
| Data Cleaning Pipeline | Cleans and normalises messy cost exports from SAP/primavera into analysis-ready DataFrames. | Pandas, regex | 📋 Planned |
